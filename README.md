# AzureBot
AzureBot is a chat bot for your Azure account. The idea is that you will be able to control your Azure resources through a familiar channel such as Skype, Slack or Messenger. This will allow you to easily query the current state of your resources and then instruct Azure to perform certain tasks. The end goal is that this can become a natural interface to the cloud, allowing free speech and text input.

# Notes
Due to certain values being pulled from the enviroment, you must ensure they are set before running either the bot or the unit tests.
